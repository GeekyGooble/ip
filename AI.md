claude.ai
#### Increment AI Tool was used: <br>
improve and fix on parser
#### What was it used for: <br>
to check and see if there are any further optimised ways I can improve on my parser class to correctly
check for the user's input and handle it well
#### Observations: <br>
interestingly, I did not catch a bug at all during my testing phases somehow
(during parser event's command, I was not aware that I wrongly passed into the from/to the wrong values)

During past tests as well I did not catch that error, which was fortunately captured by claude.

It also gave insightful feedbacks on what I could do to improve on the parser such as the addition
of pre-validation steps early on to provide a more robust flow of catching user errors, alongside more
thorough checks to ensure that there is no loopholes or fallthroughs that might crash my code during 
execution

### Prompt Number: 2 <br>
#### AI Tool Utilised: <br>
claude.ai
#### Increment AI Tool was used: <br>
improve and fix on parser
#### What was it used for: <br>
to utilise a few manual inputs I can give my bot to see if the actual desired method is returned, and
the correct catching of errors from the user could be  
#### Observations: <br>
Time-Consumings tasks such as considering the series of inputs that I should test to see if my bot works,
could often be avoided and is more efficient if ai tools are used to help generate the reccomended list
of inputs instead. Since human error may also result in missing out some inputs (i.e. edge cases) which 
ai would be able to catch more effectively instead.

The inputs given were also of wide range and variety, allowing me to test the different types of inputs 
that a user may put to "try and break the system", and also indicates which should be validated as a 
correct user input command and which should not be.
